Cooking challenge randomizer

When this script is run it will generate random output of who will be assigned to what course/ingredient at Austin's birthday party. 

This does not randomize names. It iterates through a pre-populated list in the script.

## Potential Improvements
- Read in a file of people/ingredients/courses or take commandline input. 
- Needs better list of ingredients.
